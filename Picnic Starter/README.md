##To use
On load, touch the button in the bottom right corner that says "Tap Here." This will bring you to the view where you can swipe right/left between pets. Swiping right will add a pet to your "Liked" pets, which you can access by tapping on "Liked" in the top right corner of the screen. To view the comprehensive list of pets, swipe up. Note that we currently don't support going back from the comprehensive list to the swipe screen, as well from the "liked" list of pets to the swipe screen.
